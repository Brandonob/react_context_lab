# Context Assignment 

For this assignment you will be making a small widgets app. 

Your app should include the following pages:

### A Weather Page 
This page gives the five day forecast of the coming weeks hi's and lo's. 

### A metronome 
This page will allow users to play a beat at some amount of beats per minutes. 

### A clock 
This page will include the current date as well as the current time. 

## The What's New? 
You may have read the previous project and thought to yourself, 'this is good practice, but nothing here is super new'. Fear not! 
Your app should also include a NavBar  that gives users the option to not only travel from page to page but also to toggle between a light and dark mode. You are required to use React Context API in order to keep track and pass the theme around. Your app should be fully styled depending on the theme. 

After you've got the theme styling working go ahead and add the ability for your app to remember what theme the user last used. You'll want to look into localStorage. 

## Bonus Section 
Allow the user to select from additional themes.
